1. What libraries did you use? Why did you use them?
  I used React (although some may consider it a framework) over Angular for a few reasons. When I spoke to Joe I mentioned that I've never worked in Angular but I am familiar with the tech and willing to learn it for the role. I thought that the amount of effort along with the time constraint will make it unideal for this assignment. Besides the frontend library/framework I used a linter along with Prettier to organize and format my code.
  
2. If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
    Due to time constraints, I passed on adding a search filter as well as creating a more suitable and functioning UI. There are some packages that I considered using to create unique keys for several components and more importantly, I would've liked restructuring and adding comments to further help with legibility.

3. Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
    I'm happy with how the pagination turned out but I know there are several ways about it that can be more efficient.

4. Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
    I think I spent most of my time trying to figure out what to render and what would be the best method of passing down the response data through props.
